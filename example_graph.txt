The top integer is the number of vertices in the graph

Each row after that starts with the vertex number (from 0 to maxvertices - 1)

Rows are formatted:
	<vertex-num> (<troop-count>) <edge list> -1

Edge list is simply the list of vertex numbers this node is connected to

Edges are automatically bidirectional (an edge from 0 to 1 implies an edge from 1 to 0)

Each edge list ends with -1

The list of rows ends with -1


Everything after the last -1 is ignored - you can run "bin/gen example_graph.txt example_graphbin" and it will run output properly

You can also run "bin/gen example_graphbin" to see the adjacency matrix

Note that since nodes cannot have edges to themselves, the diagonal in the binary file adjacency matrix is populated with that vertex's troop count
to save space
