=================================
Build Instructions:
=================================
 - Run "make kratos" to build the project.
 - Run bin/gen <graph-type> <vertices> <troops-per-territory> <outputfilename> to create a graph binary
	-Graph type = complete, wheel, or star
- You can also create a user-defined graph by running bin/gen <inputfile> <outputfilename>
	-Refer to the included example_graph.txt file for the format of the input file 

=================================
Run Instructions:
=================================
 - Place the graph binary you want to run the simulation on in input
 - Rename it to 'graphbin'
 - Run "mpirun -np <N> bin/risk" to run the simulator.
 - Binary output can be found in the graphs/ directory
     - To convert binary output to .png files, run extras/scripts/to_gv.sh (this will create graphviz files as well as .png renders)
-Example .pngs are included for a run on a wheel graph of 10 vertices
