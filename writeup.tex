	\begin{abstract}
		In this paper, we describe a territory-conquest simulation modeled on the classic board game \emph{RISK} and present a parallelized method for efficiently simulating multiple rounds of the model. 
		Players compete on a gameboard represented by an undirected graph, with vertices and edges representing territories and their borders, respectively. 
		Using MPI, we distributed the computation and resolution of player actions between multiple compute nodes in order to acheive the speed neccessary to simulate massive games in a reasonable amount of time. 
		This was acheived via a randomized algorithm that partitioned the computational work between nodes, combined with by a pair of message-passing cycles that communicated the results of the computations to each node. 
		In performance testing, we found this method to scale reasonably with the size of the input graph, with expected variation depending on the graph shape (complete graphs performing better than stars, etc).

		\section*{Introduction}
		
		Our simulation is designed as a territory-conquest simulator, with multiple teams competing against one another to dominate the entirety of the gameboard. 
		The gameboard itself is laid out as an undirected graph in which territories correspond to vertices and borders between territories correspond to edges.
		Each territory has a troop count, representing the number of soliders currently stationed in that territory, as well as a team affiliation, representing the team currently controlling it.
		Gameplay consists of a series of turns, each with two stages. 
		During the troop placement stage, each territory determines how many troops from its army to place on each of its borders.
		Troops placed on a border with another territory may either be attacking that territory or defending against an attack.
		After all troops have been placed, the game proceeds to the conflict resolution stage.
		Along every edge of the graph (every border between territories), a battle takes place if at least one of the territories chose to attack during the placement stage (if both teams defend, no battle takes place and all troops survive).
		Battles are resolved in the following fashion: 
		Territories flip a number of coins depending on the action they chose (attack or defend) and the amount of troops they have stationed on the edge where the battle is taking place. 
		Attacking territories flip one coin per solider; defending territories flip two coins per solider.
		After all coins are flipped, the number of heads for each side is tallied and subtracted from the number of opposing soliders on that edge (each coin flip is a gunshot; each heads is a successful hit and kill).
		This coin flipping process repeats until one or both territories have no further soliders remaining on that edge. 
		After all battles are resolved, surviving attacking troops proceed into the territory they were attacking, while defending troops retreat back to the territory they were defending. 
		The team with the largest number of troops present in a given territory after the battle phase becomes the new owner of that territory, and troops from other teams currently occupying the territory are considered killed.
		Territories are then given a 'recruitment bonus' (a number of troops added to their troop count) depending on their current troop count - this is currently 20 percent but is easily configurable within the rules of the game.
		The turn is then considered completed, and the game proceeds back to the troop placement stage.
		The game ends if, at the end of a turn, one of three conditions is met. 
		If every territory is controlled by a single team, that team is considered the winner. 
		Likewise, if only one team still has troops remaining on the board (territories may lose all troops but remain unconquered), it is considered the winner.
		Finally, if no troops remain on the board, the game is considered a draw and the gameboard begins recovering from the armageddon that has transpired (for the sake of this simulation, we do not model the reconstruction of humanity)

		\section*{Implementation BALLS}
		Our parallelized simulation models each game round in two main phases. 
		First, the edge-conflict resolution phase determines and computes the outcomes of all 'battles' that occurred during the round, with each battle taking place on an edge (a border between territories). 
		Next, the vertex-conflict resolution phase uses the data from the edge-conflict phase to decide which territories were conquered by which teams.
